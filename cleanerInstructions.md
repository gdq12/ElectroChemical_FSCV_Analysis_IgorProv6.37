Because of patchmaster's software limitations, patchmaster had to be programmed to stimulate a command voltage twice in 1 sweep at 93ms apart so the command voltage could be sent at 10Hz in real time. To be able to analyze every pulse individually, the "redimension" command in the procedure files re-adjusts the current sweep so that the first pulse is labelled as an odd number wave while the second pulse is labelled as an even numbered wave. The command accounts for numerical sequential ordering of the wave names for consecutive analysis functions. 

For assuring background current stability and due to patchmaster software design, .dat files created during data acquisition are unnecessarily large and essentially have a lot of "junk" voltage and current sweeps. The FSCVcleaner_Aug19.ipf was created as a speedy way to delete the unnecessary voltage and current waves. So the analyzer should know which current sweep number to delete prior to using this.
